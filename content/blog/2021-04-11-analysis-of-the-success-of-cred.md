CRED has been one such product that has entered the market with a bang. It has become an unicorn with 2.2 Billion valuation.CRED is an Indian startup that simplifies ‘Credit Card Payment’ and it is its core use-cases.

So here is what I believe the Product Managers at Cred might have done.

First — Solve a real user need and provide amazing convenience through the app. Credit card payment was always difficult in India — especially if you didn’t have a savings/current bank account with the provider. For example, if you banked with HDFC and used Standard Chartered only for Credit Card, then making card bill payments was a massive pain — requiring you to input card details, bill amount and payment details manually. Cred simplified it by doing all the hard work for you — all you needed to do was select bill amount and pay. It provided allied services like credit score, card statements etc. But those are not the primary use case.

Secondly, as we often realize, having a useful product alone is not enough. Increasing adoption and engagement is often the challenge. Reinforcement learning is a useful strategy for this.

# Cred user Adoption Strategy:

Exclusivity (Create intrigue): Cred initially marketed as a members only app. And becoming a member gives you certain exclusive benefits. This exclusivity brings with it a sense of intrigue and premium feeling to the app. Over the years a similar strategy has been adopted by Gmail, Facebook to bring this sense of exclusivity and intrigue through invite only growth in the beginning. A note for caution though is that ‘Exclusivity’ as a strategy might not be ideal for every product- it has to tie into your larger business model. For Cred — they tied the exclusivity based on a users credit score. Anyone with a score of above 750 could enter.So basically user with a scrore 750+ will have good credit history and they are folks who use credit card often in India

# Cred's reinforcement mechanics : 

Gems (Referral reward): Referral is also a common strategy used for increasing adoption across many products. What Cred did here slightly differently was using reinforcement mechanics. Every referral got you ‘Gems’. You could see your gems grow and you can sell these gems for cool rewards.

Coins: Every time someone uses the app to make payment — they earn cred coins. They could have made 1 Rupee = 1 Cred Coin. But to give a sense of higher earning, coins are awarded disproportionately higher than the amount you pay for.

And these coins can then be redeemed in two ways

1. **Fixed rewards:** You could exchange coins for fixed rewards — discounts from partners, pay for experian credit scores etc.

 **  2. Variable Rewards through Games:** Or you could play a game and win rewards. You can    keep spending coins and buy slots and play games.



# CRED’s successful growth story with IPL 2020

It’s noteworthy how a comparatively new brand like CRED made the best of this by running its campaign to its targeted users on television. It reached out to its premium class of audience i.e the first-generation wealthy, by leveraging the HD feed only for the IPL matches - helping the brand to target the audience who is more likely to use credit cards. This was a well-strategized customer acquisition move by filtering out a segment of a non-relatable audience group.

IPL’s 2020 edition had enough buzz ever since the news of the sporting event hit the stands. Played during the pandemic, the event managed to trigger high anticipation of both – fans and brands. CRED approached the league with the idea of not just leveraging the massive audience base (including the platform’s affluent and premium TG) but also educating the TG with brand messages around financial literacy on credit card payments.

CRED hasn’t been a robust advertiser since its inception but advertised heavily during IPL 2020, especially leveraging broadcast. Contrary to the popular belief of television only fulfilling the needs of well-established brands, CRED proves on point why broadcast associations are still meaningful and leverage-worthy. Especially for online businesses, advertising on TV is vital as it not just leads to credibility but accords an exposure that is unmatched. While associations with large marquee events like IPL do give brands an audience but to make it fruitful, brands need to ensure – through their marketing campaigns & choice of advertising medium – that the audience is at the edge of their seats – be it on the ground or on their television sets.

# Conclusion

Over 100 million user visits happened on the CRED App during IPL. The platform managed to reach a massive audience base and additionally created an intrigue about the product which led to exploration and further, conversation.Apart from these, I have been very impressed at the design, business model of the CRED app and I think I would certainly enjoy discussing with those behind the product.
