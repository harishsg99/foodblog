Hey guys, In this article, I am gonna compare both react.js and vue.js based on following criterias 

1.popularity

2.community support and developers engagement

3.learning curve

4.size

5.usecases

# What is the difference between react and vue

<!--StartFragment-->

To stay unbiased, I would suggest starting looking at the differences between React and Vue.js in Vue.js documentation(which is quite good and addresses the topic quite well). It was written by Evan You in cooperation with Dan Abramov(from the React team).

Both Vue and React use virtual DOM(each of them has different implementation though).

***The main difference between Vue.js and React is that Vue.js uses templates with declarative rendering while React uses JSX, which is a pretty much a JS extension that allows using HTML within it.*** That means React requires more complex implementations for even simple tasks(comparing to Vue.js or even Angular), at the very end one needs more time to develop a complex component too.

At the same time, Vue.js is more high-level and has a much lower entry point as Vue.js does not require one to deeply understand JS Core to perform.

Both React and Vue.js are suitable for small and mid-sized projects.

# Popularity

<!--StartFragment-->

React has been a leader in popularity among JavaScript frameworks. It takes the first place with the number of 48,718 dependents, whereas, Vue.js is the second most popular JavaScript framework with half as many dependents — 21,575, as reported by Node Package Manager. Though, if we take a look at statistics at the end of 2018, we will see that Vue’s dependents had tripled, while React’s had doubled.

Though we can see that the number of questions on stackoverflow about Vue.js is going up, it’s doubtless that React is still on the top spot of the podium.

According to the fourth edition of JavaScript Rising Stars that estimates the number of stars added on Github during each year, Vue has taken the first place in 2019.

This statistics is quite confusing as it doesn’t correspond to any aforementioned numbers. Maybe the Vue community is just obsessed with GitHub stars.

# Community support

Relying on the Github statistics, we can make a conclusion about how popular Vue.js is among its open source community, even without the support from a top-level corporate.

Facebook engineers are continuously working on React maintenance and coding, improving it and investing in it which makes React the most rapidly growing tool in the developers’ world.

# Flexibility and learning curve

One of the biggest advantages of React is flexibility. As React is not a full-fledged framework but a library, it’s also quite easy to learn. Instead of working in a set pattern, a developer can add any library according to their preferences. MobX and Redux are also widely used by developers while working with React to support state management tasks.

Vue.js is also flexible and has no restrictions on how to build your application. It also offers official support for a variety of build systems, moreover, the learning process won’t take much time: acquaintance with such basics as HTML and ES5 JavaScript are the only basics you need to get started.

# size

The size of the framework is a crucial criterion that directly influences the productivity of projects, the smaller the framework is, the better it is for a project. If to round off the size of frameworks, React is around 100 Kb whereas Vue.js is around 80 Kb. Both of them have a relatively small size which makes them convenient for the development of small applications.

# Use cases

When choosing a technology for a project, it’s also vital to know where this technology has been already used.

**React.js app development examples:**

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Instagram
* Skype

**Vue.js app development examples:**

* Gitlab
* 9Gag
* Nintendo
* Grammarly

To sum up, React is currently more popular than Vue. It has a strong and influential mentor that improves and maintains it, while Vue doesn’t. Vue.js and React.js provide high flexibility, easy learning curve, and both are small in size.

# Conclusions

So, is Vue going to take over React? but not in 2021 may be in 2023 or 2025,
