Hey folks, My name is Harish,I am back with one more interesting write up which i found in RDP. I will explain little bit about my methodology once I found the target to hunt first i will analyse the site like normal user by creating account and i will understand target by using it as normal user. After that i will start with my favorite bug, i.e account takeover.

As usual i was hunting for account takeover. I created two accounts and I click on forget password, after that i checked my mail there i got the code that time 2 tricks started running on my head

1.Response manipulation

2.OTP bypass by no rate limit

First I tried for response manipulation I entered wrong otp, i captured the request in burp suite, and i saw response, it was status code 400 bad request then i changed the response to 200 OK and success but bad luck not bypassed. i was like ok lets move to the second trick

Then I decided to brute force the OTP because it was 4 Digit code we can do it in short time, so I requested for new OTP without seeing OTP I entered one random OTP and Captured the request in burp and i sent it to intruder, there I added the number payload 0000 to 9999 and started attack.

You can see the status code 200 here I bypassed the OTP successfully. Using this bug I can hack any users without user interaction.
