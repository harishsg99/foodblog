It’s advertised as a virtual *internship*, but their policy states that the program may not be listed as work experience. In resumes, it must be included under ‘Extracurricular Activities’, ‘Certifications’, or ‘Achievements’. LinkedIn references to the program must be in the ‘Licenses and Certifications’ section. The policy provides the wording that must be used in any reference and nowhere does it include the word ‘internship’. It’s always referred to as a ‘virtual experience program’.

While it may not be the *internship* it initially claims, it’s worthwhile as a certificate. The program doesn’t take long to finish (less than a week), and you have a legit certificate with your name alongside a reputable company like JPMorgan Chase.

# Task Details

Like I mentioned earlier, the program took me less than a week to finish. There are three tasks with an optional fourth, but they automatically send the digital certificate as soon as you finish the third. Each task comes with detailed instructions on the goal of the task and how to accomplish it.

The hardest part of the tasks for me was setting up my local environment with the software required to complete each task. Part of the detailed instructions for each task includes set up instructions. The tasks use python and nvm so I had to install them and came across some issues. Thankfully the setup instructions included troubleshooting slides that covered most of the set up issues I encountered.

After setting up the environment properly, completing each task is as simple as following directions. Task 1 requires you to edit a few methods in a python file, so the information from the server is used properly by the client to formulate certain data. Task 2 involves editing a few files in the client side React application. We can see the progress in Task 2, because we are working towards rendering a graph with certain information displayed in a specific way. Task 3 has us editing two files in the React application to update the graph to display more useful information for the financial traders who would use the application.


Each task comes with its own specific, well written instructions that include screenshots, so that a novice could complete each task. Like every programming project in history, there were some unforeseen errors but nothing that a little Googling couldn’t fix.

# Takeaways

It’s a unique course. There are tons and tons of online software engineering courses, but this is the first open experience I’ve seen that’s tailored toward a specific company. Each task details how that assignment works in tandem with the JPMorgan Chase financial analysts.

It’s free. I failed to mention that earlier.

Not a big time commitment. They say it takes 5 hours to complete, and that estimate was on the money for me. It will most likely take longer for someone who is completely new to programming.

You leave with something to show for your work. If you’re searching for jobs in software engineering, it’s always nice to have tangible certificates to showcase your abilities.
